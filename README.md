# My Game Project

This project is a basic structure for a 2D game built with Phaser (frontend) and Node.js with SQLite (backend).

## Structure

*   `frontend/`: Contains the Phaser game files.
    *   `index.html`: The main HTML file to load the game.
    *   `game.js`: The Phaser game logic.
    *   `assets/`:  (currently contains `sky.png`, you will add more game assets)
*   `backend/`:  Contains the Node.js server.
    *   `server.js`: The main server file, handles API requests and database interactions.
    *   `database.db`: The SQLite database file (will be created automatically).
    *   `package.json`: Node.js project file, lists dependencies.

## Getting Started

### Frontend

1.  Open `frontend/index.html` in a web browser.

### Backend

1.  Navigate to the `backend` directory in your terminal.
2.  Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3.  Run `npm start` to start the server (it will usually run on port 3000).

## Next Steps:

*   **Frontend:**
    *   Add more game assets.
    *   Implement game logic (player movement, enemies, collision detection, etc.).
    *   Connect to the backend API to send/receive data (e.g., high scores).
*   **Backend:**
    *   Expand the API routes to handle more game data.
    *   Consider adding user authentication.
    *   Improve error handling and security.
    *   (Optional) Serve the frontend files from the backend.
